# CurseToken Frontend Integration

This project demonstrates how to connect the CurseToken smart contract to a frontend application built using Next.js. It allows users to interact with the CurseToken smart contract, enabling them to mint and burn tokens.

## Description

The CurseToken frontend application provides a simple interface for users to connect their MetaMask wallet, view their token balance, and perform mint and burn operations on the CurseToken smart contract. The frontend is built using React and Next.js, with ethers.js handling the interaction with the Ethereum blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/developer-kush/CurseTokenFrontend.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd CurseTokenFrontend
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Executing program

1. Start the Ethereum local blockchain:
    ```bash
    npm run eth
    ```

2. Deploy the smart contract:
    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```

3. Start the Next.js development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the CurseToken application.

## Help

For common issues, ensure:
1. You have MetaMask installed in your browser.
2. Your MetaMask wallet is connected to the local blockchain network.
3. The smart contract is deployed to the correct address specified in the `contractAddress` variable.

For more help, refer to the [ethers.js documentation](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) or the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).
